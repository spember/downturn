### _Be Greedy when others are Fearful_

This small app was thrown together during several train rides during my morning commute. The goal was to practice with
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), the latest version of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and see how they might work with
 a [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) application.

The app is hardly functional, but I leave it here as a remainder to resume working on it at some point.

Application outline:

-enter stock quotes
-lookup, display response to user
-track quote and keep average per day
